== Creating test database

By default unit tests use MySQL database but PostgreSQL and Oracle databases are supported as well. Set MONDRIAN_DRIVER environment variable to "mysql" (default), "postgresql" or "oracle" to specify database driver that should be used.

If using MySQL or PostgreSQL database then create database user mondrian_test with password mondrian_test, create database mondrian_test and grant full access to this database for mondrian_test user. By default it is assumed that database is located on localhost (can be overridden with DATABASE_HOST environment variable).

If using Oracle database then create database user mondrian_test with password mondrian_test. By default it is assumed that database orcl is located on localhost (can be overridden with DATABASE_NAME and DATABASE_HOST environment variables).

See spec/spec_helper.rb for details of default connection parameters and how to override them.

== Creating test data

Install necessary gems with

  bundle install

Create tables with test data using

  rake db:create_data

or specify which database driver to use

  rake db:create_data MONDRIAN_DRIVER=mysql
  rake db:create_data MONDRIAN_DRIVER=postgresql
  rake db:create_data MONDRIAN_DRIVER=oracle

== Running tests

Run tests with

  rake spec

or specify which database driver to use

  rake spec MONDRIAN_DRIVER=mysql
  rake spec MONDRIAN_DRIVER=postgresql
  rake spec MONDRIAN_DRIVER=oracle

== JRuby versions

It is recommended to use RVM (http://rvm.beginrescueend.com) to run tests with different JRuby implementations. mondrian-olap has been tested with JRuby 1.5 and 1.6 release candidate versions.
